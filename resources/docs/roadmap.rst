Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

A new bundle can never promise BC from the start. The ``0.x`` serie can
contain BC breaks. When a new version in this serie is released, an
``UPGRADE`` file will be available with information on how to update your
project.

As of ``1.0``, there will be no longer BC breaks in the minor versions.
