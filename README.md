# WouterJEloquentBundle

The WouterJEloquentBundle claims to integrate the [Eloquent ORM][eloquent]
into the Symfony2 framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WouterJ/WouterJEloquentBundle.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WouterJ/WouterJEloquentBundle)

## Installation

The recommend way to install the bundle is using [Composer][composer]. Since
this bundle uses the PSR-4 autoloading, be sure to **always update Composer**
to the latest version before installing the bundle:

    $ php composer.phar require wouterj/eloquent-bundle 0.1.*

After the bundle and the Eloquent ORM are installed, register the bundle in
your kernel:

    // app/AppKernel.php

    // ...
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...
            new Wj\EloquentBundle\WjEloquentBundle(),
        );

        // ...
        return $bundles;
    }

### Configuration

To use the Eloquent ORM and its database features, you need to configure the
bundle with the database information:

    wouterj_eloquent:
        driver: mysql
        host: localhost
        database: db_name
        username: root
        password: pass
        prefix: ''
